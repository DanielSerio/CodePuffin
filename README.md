# CodePuffin 🐧

> **Enforce your architecture, not just your code style.**

## What is CodePuffin?

**CodePuffin** is a high-performance architectural enforcement engine for TypeScript projects.

In the agentic era, code generation is fast, but architectural drift is faster. While ESLint catches bad code patterns and TypeScript ensures type safety, CodePuffin operates at the **module graph level** to ensure your codebase stays within the boundaries of your intended design.

By leveraging the **TypeScript Compiler API**, CodePuffin provides deep, deterministic, and near-instant feedback on your project's modular health.

### 🌟 Why CodePuffin?

- **🏗️ Architecturally Aware**: Move beyond simple linting. Enforce modular boundaries, layer-specific standards (UI vs. Data Layer), and Public API surfaces that traditional tools ignore.
- **🤖 Agent-Optimized**: Generates high-fidelity markdown reports specifically structured for AI coding assistants, enabling autonomous architectural compliance.
- **🚀 Blazing Fast**: Near-instant AST analysis. It's not just a checker; it's a real-time architectural guardrail that runs at the speed of thought.
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: 100% local. Your intellectual property never leaves your machine. No tokens, no hallucinations, just pure logic.

## 📐 Core Principles

| Tool           | Level     | Focus                       |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| ESLint         | File      | Code patterns & Style       |
| TypeScript     | Type      | Type safety & correctness   |
| **CodePuffin** | **Graph** | **Architectural integrity** |

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

- **Import Boundaries**: Control which modules are allowed to talk to each other (e.g., Features cannot import from other Features).
- **Layer Violations**: Enforce Clean/Layered architecture by ensuring dependencies only flow in one direction.
- **Public API Enforcement**: Force imports through barrel exports (`index.ts`), preventing deep, brittle imports into internal module structures.
- **Cycle Detection**: Advanced graph analysis to detect and visualize circular dependencies that lead to tight coupling.

## Interface

CodePuffin has two primary interfaces:

- **CLI**: Standardized scanning for local development and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Framework Plugins**: Real-time feedback integrated into Vite, Next.js, and more.

### CLI

```bash
# scan current directory
puffin scan

# scan with custom config
puffin scan --config puffin.json
```

### Framework Plugins

#### Vite Plugin

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import codePuffin from 'codepuffin/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    codePuffin({
      // options
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Configuration

CodePuffin uses `puffin.json` to define your architectural manifest. All named patterns (modules, layers, areas) are centralized in the root `modules` registry.

```json
{
  "project": {
    "include": ["src/**/*"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.test.*"],
    "aliases": { "@/*": "src/*" }
  },
  "modules": {
    "app": "src/app/**/*",
    "features": "src/features/*",
    "ui": "src/components/**/*",
    "domain": "src/domain/**",
    "infra": "src/infrastructure/**"
  },
  "rules": {
    "module-boundaries": {
      "severity": "error",
      "rules": [
        {
          "importer": "features",
          "imports": "features",
          "allow": false,
          "message": "Features cannot import other features directly"
        },
        { "importer": "features", "imports": "app", "allow": false }
      ]
    },
    "layer-violations": {
      "severity": "error",
      "allowed": [
        { "importer": "ui", "imports": ["domain"] },
        { "importer": "infra", "imports": ["domain"] }
      ]
    },
    "public-api-only": {
      "severity": "error",
      "modules": ["features"],
      "exceptions": ["**/*.test.ts"]
    },
    "circular-dependencies": {
      "severity": "error",
      "maxDepth": 10
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "markdown",
    "reportFile": "./reports/puffin-report.md"
  }
}
```

## Features

### 📐 Rules (Current)

- **Module Boundaries**: Prevent "spaghetti" dependencies between features.
- **Layered Integrity**: Enforce top-down dependency flow (Clean/Hexagonal).
- **Public API Guards**: Protect internal module implementation details.
- **Circular Insight**: Detect and break tight coupling cycles.

### 📊 Reporting

- **Stylish Console**: Real-time terminal feedback.
- **Agent-Ready Markdown**: Reports designed to be "missions" for AI coding agents.
- **Actionable JSON**: For custom CI/CD integrations.

### 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Feature Structure**: Enforce consistent internal folder layouts.
- **I/O Boundaries**: Restrict Side Effects (fetch, localStorage) to specific layers.
- **Puffin Graph**: Visual dependency graph generation (SVG/Mermaid).
- **Framework Presets**: One-click config for Next.js, React, and Monorepos.
